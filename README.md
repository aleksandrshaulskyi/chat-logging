Chat-Logging

Logging microservice for the distributed chat system

Overview

This microservice provides centralized logging via the classic ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), with Filebeat used as the log shipper.

It includes pre-built Kibana dashboards with both list-style log views and graphical visualizations.
All dashboards are located in the /kibana_dashboards/ directory and can be imported directly into Kibana.

Note: In ~90% of practical cases I would choose a modern, lightweight stack like OpenTelemetry + Prometheus + Grafana + Loki.
It’s simpler, more lightweight, and you'll likely use Prometheus/Grafana for metrics anyway.

Development Stage

Active development.
Updates are released several times a week.
